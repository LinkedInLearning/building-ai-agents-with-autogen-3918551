      "\n",
      "2. **Middle Scenes (Living Room, Kitchen, Bathroom):**\n",

      "   - Example dialogue:\n",
      "     - **Dad Mike:** \"Let's see if this green cleaner can tackle this stain as well as our usual brand.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "### Final Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Visuals and Audio:**\n",
      "   - Use bright, natural lighting to emphasize cleanliness and health.\n",
